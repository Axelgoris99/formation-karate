# Formation Karate

This repo is the one I will be putting my templates and note from my animation karate formation.

## Typst

I'll be using Typst for everything. If you want to change and recreate a PDF, install typst and compile it.

## Resources

For colors and such, I took everything from the graphical guide on this page: <https://www.ffkarate.fr/identite-visuelle/>
